## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

JustInvoice is built using **React** for the UI and **TailwindCSS** for styling. The app uses component-based state management to dynamically update invoice values as the user types.

### Step-by-Step Flow:

1. **User Enters Information**
   - Business & client details
   - Invoice number and date
   - Item/service list (with qty & price)

2. **Live Calculation**
   - Totals are calculated as you type using JavaScript

3. **Print Button**
   - Clicking print opens the browser's print dialog
   - You can choose to save as PDF or send to a printer

4. **No Login or Save**
   - It's meant for quick generation. You can print/export the invoice immediately.
   - Data resets on page refresh
